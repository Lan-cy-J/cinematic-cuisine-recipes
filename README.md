# ðŸŽ¬ Cinematic Cuisine



Welcome to Cinematic Cuisine, an interactive recipe book where every dish is inspired by the magic of the movies! This web application allows users to browse a collection of famous fictional foods, filter them by genre or difficulty, and even find out what they can cook with the ingredients they already have at home.





->Features



* Recipe of the Day: A new, randomly selected movie-themed recipe is featured on every visit.



* Interactive Filtering: Easily sort and filter recipes by genre (category), difficulty, or dietary preference.



* Smart Search: A dynamic search bar that finds recipes by their movie title, generic dish name (e.g., "burger"), or by a specific ingredient.



* The "Pantry Pal": Users can add ingredients they own to a virtual pantry. The app then highlights which recipes they can make and sorts the list to show the best matches first.



* Detailed Recipe Modal: Clicking on any recipe card opens a beautiful pop-up with a larger image, a full ingredient list, step-by-step instructions, and fun movie trivia.



* Fully Responsive Design: The layout is optimized for a seamless experience on both desktop and mobile devices.





-> Technologies Used



* This project was built using a combination of front-end technologies:



* HTML5: For the structure and content of the web pages.



* CSS3: For all custom styling, animations, and the unique "Cinematic Cuisine" theme.



* JavaScript (ES6): For all the interactive logic, including filtering, searching, and the "Pantry Pal" functionality.



* Bootstrap 5: As a framework for the responsive grid system, modals, and other UI components.



* jQuery: To simplify DOM manipulation and event handling.



* Google Fonts: For the elegant, custom typography (Cinzel and Lato) that defines the theme.
